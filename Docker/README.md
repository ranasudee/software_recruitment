# Docker

Write a Dockerfile that sets up a web server using Python and serves the `index.html` file located in the same directory as this README.

The Dockerfile should perform the following steps:
1. Install Python
2. Copy the `index.html` file into the container, placing it in a dedicated folder
3. Configure the Dockerfile to start a Python web server that serves files from the folder where the `index.html` file is located

Feel free to use whichever port you find suitable.
